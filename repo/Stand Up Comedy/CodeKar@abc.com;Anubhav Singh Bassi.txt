A lawyer-turned-UPSC aspirant-turned-entrepreneur-turned-comic, 
Anubhav Bassi is finally doing something productive after many failures 
because he thinks that his failures are his achievements.
 A perfect storyteller who makes fun of 
himself and everything that has come in his way till date. 
His style of comedy is interestingly natural with the 
whole act that seems like a casual conversation with hilarious content. 
One of the best stand-up comedians of the next gen.
