Abhishek Upmanyu is a stand-up comedian, writer and a haiku enthusiast.
He looks and sounds like a regular Delhi boy, except that he is harmless. 
He does kill though, mostly on stage, and has done so at the biggest 
of stages on the stand-up circuit. Upmanyu covers seemingly everyday 
topics with insightful and hilarious effects. With his Shatabdi-fast delivery 
and writing prowess, rap is an alternate career option for Abhishek but he 
refuses on principal. Having moved to Mumbai recently 
for 'better prospects' that may or may not materialize 
but is bound to make for some crazy material.
