Jaspreet is a very innocent looking guy who derives most of his humor from the things happening 
in his house and around him in the city. He sometimes feel that world is really stupid place to live 
in and he contributes his bit by making fun of stupidity he observes in the real life. 
Very straightforward in the way he delivers, watch him share about his observation of life in a metro,
 things he hates doing and meet his family through his set.
Koi Load Nahi, a chilled-out standup comedy 
show about Jaspreet`s journey post viral videos, 
childhood stories with everything personal,
 political and motivational in-between. 
This show has toured the United States, 
Ireland, England and Australia and is now playing near you.
