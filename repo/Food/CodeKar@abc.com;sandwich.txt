Grilled cheese sandwich
Ingredients - Bread, Butter, cheddar Cheese, capsicum,tomatoes and cucumber.


Steps: 
1) Start with great bread.
Now, this isn’t to say that you can’t use any bread that you have in your pantry already. If you have the option, however, I suggest buying some crusty whole grain or regular sourdough for maximally awesome flavor.

2) Top with high quality, sharp cheddar cheese.
Sharp cheddar has a lot of flavor, and that’s what we’re going for. When it comes to a grilled cheese, you really can’t go light on the cheese, or you’re going to be disappointed.

3) Don’t skimp on the butter.
You need enough butter to achieve the crackly-crisp, buttery, golden exterior that we all crave. If you always keep a stick of butter on the counter, you can simply spread the softened butter generously over the outside pieces of bread. If you don’t (I don’t), you can melt a pat of butter in the skillet before you add the bread.

4) Grate the cheese yourself.
Pre-shredded cheeses are lightly coated in starch so they don’t stick together, but the starch prevents your cheese from melting into gooey oblivion. We want gooey oblivion.

5) Cover your grilled cheese while it cooks.
This helps trap the heat, which ensures that your grilled cheese has time to melt all the way through without burning on the outside.
