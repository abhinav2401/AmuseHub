"Jai Ho" is a song composed by A. R. Rahman for the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire. 

When Danny Boyle, the director of Slumdog Millionaire, approached Rahman to compose 
its soundtrack, he included the song. "Jai Ho" accompanies a choreographed dance sequence 
at the end credits of the film. Indian singer Tanvi Shah wrote and provided vocals for an 
English section of the song. "Jai Ho" is a phrase which can be roughly translated as "Let 
[the] victory prevail", "Let there be victory", or "May there always be victory".
